"My husbands doctors office has been closed since Sunday . We were told by his service that they would open at 8:00am this morning . He finished his meds yesterday and was to see the doctor . The office has no power and they are closed . He needs his meds , one of which if he does not take can cause seizures if he stops abruptly . We have called the service every 30 minutes , as his doctor is going away until the 19th of November . Today was to be his last day at the office . His service keeps telling us they will have him call us , but we have heard nothing . This and his other meds will not be prescribed by another doctor as he also needs a narcotic .

"Hello . I am a teacher at a Montessori middle school in Norwalk , Connecticut . Our students are carrying out a few storm relief initiatives at school , including one that is rather impractical , but hopefully , spiritually uplifting ! Our students are making their own cheery , encouraging labels for something like 1,500 chocolate bars , which they would like to deliver personally to the storm victims of Staten Island . We have not yet figured out the logistics of this and I wonder if you could give us some direction . We are hoping to come as a small group on Sunday for a few hours to try to spread some `` sweetness '' and to let Staten Islanders know that they may feel alone , but they are not ! Is there a place that you could direct us to in order to fulfill our mission ? Thank you for advising ... . ******************",Food,resource
